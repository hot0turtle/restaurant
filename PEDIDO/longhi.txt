Introduced onchange event where instead of needing to repressing the buttom 
simply selecting the dish will automaticaly update the price where as my original
code would only update once the buttom was pressed. when using change events the price
would not change automaticaly if the selects where cleared so added "total()" which 
resets total to 0
